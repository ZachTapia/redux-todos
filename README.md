# Redux-Todos
A basic todo app built using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux), [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) libraries. This was my first project using Redux, and was intended as a learning exercise.

## Functionality:
- List Todos
- Add Todos
- Delete Todos
- "Focus" on a Todo and display it larger
- Filter the list of Todos based on completed/incomplete
